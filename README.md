# TicTacToe

Design a classic Tic Tac Toe game where the user can make turns against an AI. The user will be asked to place a symbol and your program should insert it into a multidimensional grid. After each turn an AI should also make its turn and the program detects when someone wins (or if there is a tie!)
Do not place all your code in the program.cs but instead create additional separate files that handle all the functions for user interface (like Console.ReadLine and WriteLine) and logic.



Rocket Tips: Utilize the things you have learned in the slotmachine about multidimensional arrays and also your knowledge about ui - logic split using functions
